# OsirisEngine
This was a learning project established years ago.
The goal was to build a game engine, which could be used as the base for 3D games (like Unity - Of course not at all as sophisticated [or funded ;)]).

It helped learning to build interchangeble architectures (switch DirectX and OpenGL), as well as how to handle system resources effectively.
Have fun browsing the code :)
